# What is NinjaTurtles?
protecting children's video identities online in a fun way! :rainbow:

# Ethos
The fun idea here is providing kids with "fun" features that actually protect them in cyber space but they don't know it, they just see fun options to use while being on the internet (ie. in zoom class) 

# Basic Features
- anonymize the child's video using video filters (on video applications) in order to protect their identity
- generate random username for child

# Extra Features

- face detection tracker (to check if young child is watching teacher)
- fun unique filters available for children (similar to the fun camera roll app in apple products)
- Creating Snapchat-like Filters (maybe ninja turtles themed?)
- child picks favourite animal (or any topic) and the randomly generated username is based on that thing (conceals their identity in a fun way)
- can add an easy emoji-child name labelling chart for the teacher's end (works for scaling classroom size)

# Benefits
- Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) - billion dollar bill acts implemented by the government
- Decreases Energy Consumption: According to a projection by IT giant Cisco, by 2022 around 60% of the world's population will be online, with video making up more than 80 percent of all internet traffic. 
-- The problem: transferring videos online is data-intensive. In 2018, online video traffic was responsible for more than 300 million tons of CO2, equivalent to what a country the size of Spain releases in a year â€” for all sectors combined. The higher a video's resolution, the more data that's required.
- Avoids identity fraud by video conference hackers
- Has a vintage vibe like the 1990s internet videoconferencing client, CU-SeeMe!

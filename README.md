# "A new kind of mask"

# What is Türtle?
NinjaTurtles is a computer vision tool build with the goal of protecting children's video identities online in a fun way! :rainbow:

# Ethos
The fun idea here is providing kids with "fun" features that actually protect them in cyber space but they don't know it, they just see fun options to use while being on the internet (i.e. in zoom class) 

# Demo

# Basic Features
Currently, it anonymizes the child's facial identity using video filters (on video applications) in order to protect their identity

# Extra Features
- Face detection tracker (to check if young child is watching teacher)
- Creating interchangeable Ninja Turtle themed Snapchat-like Filters to conceal identity

# Benefits
- Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) - billion dollar bill acts implemented by the government
- Decreases Energy Consumption: According to a projection by IT giant Cisco, by 2022 around 60% of the world's population will be online, with video making up more than 80 percent of all internet traffic. 
-- The problem: transferring videos online is data-intensive. In 2018, online video traffic was responsible for more than 300 million tons of CO2, equivalent to what a country the size of Spain releases in a year — for all sectors combined. The higher a video's resolution, the more data that's required.
- Avoids identity fraud by video conference hackers
- Has a vintage vibe like the 1990s internet videoconferencing client, CU-SeeMe!
